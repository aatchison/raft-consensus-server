## [Unreleased]

## [1.0.0] - 2025-06-03

### Added - Initial Implementation

#### Core Raft Algorithm
- **Complete Raft consensus implementation** with leader election, log replication, and safety guarantees
- **Three node states**: Follower, Candidate, and Leader with proper state transitions

- **Logging configuration** with file-based persistence

#### Testing and Validation
- **Comprehensive test suite** (`test_raft.py`) covering:
  - Leader election scenarios
  - Log replication verification
  - Network partition simulation
  - Client interaction testing
  - Cluster recovery validation
- **Multi-node test scenarios** with automated setup
- **Performance benchmarking** capabilities
- **Error condition testing** for robustness validation

#### Documentation
- **Complete README** with setup, usage, and API documentation
- **Deployment guide** (`DEPLOYMENT.md`) with production considerations
- **Code comments** throughout all modules for maintainability
- **API documentation** via FastAPI's automatic OpenAPI generation
- **Architecture overview** with Raft algorithm explanation

#### Development Infrastructure
- **Requirements specification** (`requirements.txt`) with all dependencies
- **Modular code structure** with clear separation of concerns:
  - `raft_node.py` - Core Raft algorithm implementation
  - `raft_server.py` - HTTP server wrapper
  - `log_entry.py` - Log entry data structures
  - `config.py` - Configuration management
  - `client.py` - Client library
  - `web_interface.py` - Web monitoring interface
  - `main.py` - Application entry point
- **Git repository setup** with proper branching strategy
- **Pull request workflow** for code review and integration

### Technical Specifications

- **Liveness Properties**: Progress guarantee under network majority availability

#### Performance Characteristics
- **Sub-second leader election** under normal conditions
- **Millisecond heartbeat intervals** for fast failure detection
- **Efficient log storage** with append-only operations
- **Memory-efficient state management** with disk persistence

#### Network Protocol
- **HTTP/JSON-based communication** for simplicity and debugging
- **RESTful API design** following standard conventions
- **Error handling** with appropriate HTTP status codes
- **Request/response validation** with proper data structures

#### Deployment Features
- **Multi-node cluster support** with configurable node addresses
- **Production-ready logging** with configurable levels
